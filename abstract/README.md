Final Project: Visualizing the Physical Barriers to Urban Park Access

Abstract
The experience of enjoying nature is a right that deserves to be protected and advocated for. In the United States, a combination of economic inequality, systemic racism, segregated, and other forms of state sanctioned violence has led to a perceivable diversity gap in outdoor spaces. Green spaces historically serve affluent, white communities, with black communities only being allowed to enter public green spaces a little over 50 years ago with the passing of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. As a naturalist, advocate for park access, and enjoyer of metropolitan areas, I am interested in exploring physical barriers to park access in urban spaces, including walkability, bike lane infrastructure, and public transit access. I want to investigate the intersection of urban infrastructure, systemic racism, and park “access” as delineated by Trust for Public Land.
