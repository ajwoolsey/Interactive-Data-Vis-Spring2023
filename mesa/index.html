       <h1>Visualizing the Barriers to Park Access</h1>
      <h4>Nature, considered the “great equalizer”<sup>1</sup> to some, should act as a public, universal good. 
      Living in proximity to a green space is associated with a wide range of mental and health benefits, 
      including a reduced risk of type II diabetes, heart disease, and lower levels of stress hormones <sup>2</sup>. 
      In urban spaces, parks and green spaces play an especially vital role in maintaining ecological homeostasis, 
      supporting climate resiliency and adaptation measures, promoting a connection to the environment, and fostering community engagement. 
      Unfortunately, the benefits of natural areas in urban spaces are not equitably distributed across demographics in the United States.</h4>

      <h4>The “nature gap” refers to the unequal distribution of natural spaces, specific to low-income communities and people
        of color. Due to a combination of systemic racism, redlining, and restrictive urban planning, there exists a massive discrepancy in green space 
      and nature access, with marginalized communities largely living in areas deprived of quality parks and natural spaces. 
      Overwhelmingly, neighborhoods of color and lower income communities have less access to parks and green spaces than white, affluent neighborhoods. 
      In cities, neighborhoods with primarily non-white residents have less green space (calculated as acreage of park/person) than predominantly white neighborhoods<sup>3</sup>.</h4>
      In order to close the park equity gap in cities, root causes of nature access discrepancies in urban spaces must be identified and investigated thoroughly.  

       <h4>This project seeks to address the issue of park access inequity in cities from a lens of structural racism in urban planning 
        and “people-oriented city design”-transit development that services urban community needs over vehicle infrastructure <sup>4</sup>. 
        Non-profit Trust for the Public Land (TPL) has an indexed ranking of park access in American cities called “ParkScore”. ParkScore uses metrics
        including total park acreage, investment, amenities, access, and equity-sourced from US Census demographic data- 
        to develop an aggregated park access ranking of America’s top 100 cities. In 2022, Washington, DC was 
        designated the most equitable US city in terms of park access with a ParkScore of 84.9, with Mesa, AZ declared the least equitable
        with a score of 31.9 <sup>5</sup>. By comparing the most and the least park equitable cities in the United States, this project hopes to 
        showcase park access inequalities as an issue of inequitable urban infrastructure. </h4> <br>

      Scatterplots
      <h4>The scatterplots below provide situational context on the relationship between people-oriented city infrastructure and park access
        by comparing ParkScore rankings of 100 US Cities to metrics of walkability, bikeability, and access to transit.
         WalkScore, a subsidiary of the real estate company RedFin, measures the walkability, bikeability, and transit accessibility of any 
         urban area, designated as Walk Score<sup>®</sup>, Bike Score<sup>®</sup>, and Transit Score<sup>®</sup>, respectively<sup>6</sup>. Data points for DC and Mesa are highlighted.
          Cities with higher walk, bike, and transit scores
          have more comprehensive people-oriented city infrastructure- including bike lanes, metro lines, and bus stations- than cities with lower scores. 
          Overwhelmingly, there is a positive correlation between walkability, bikeability, transit access, and park equity, suggesting a relationship between 
          people-oriented city infrastructure and park equity in the United States. </h4>

    Maps
    <h4>The below maps show the geographic proximity of people-oriented city infrastructure- bike lanes, metro lines, and bus stations- 
      to parks and urban green spaces in Mesa, AZ and Washington, DC. Geographic data for DC bus routes, bike lanes, 
      metro routes, and green spaces were sourced from Open Data DC<sup>7,8,9,10</sup>
      Geographic data for Mesa light rail route and bus stop locations were sourced from Valley Metro Open Data<sup>11,12</sup>, bike lane data from
      City of Mesa ArcGIS Online<sup>13</sup>, and park data from City of Mesa Park Finder<sup>14</sup>. With regards to public transit, DC's 
      urban infrastructure is far more people-oriented than Mesa's, with a rapid rail transit system and a comprehensive network of public bus stations
      that within proximity of green spaces; particularly in the northwestern quadrant of the city. <br>

      <sup>*</sup> City of Mesa GIS did not have a publicly available geographic shp file for green spaces, so the coordinates of each park and acreage 
      had to be used instead. <br>
      <sup>**</sup>Mesa, AZ has a light rail system while Washington, DC has a rapid rail system. 
      Light rail systems typically use small trains powered by overhead electrical wires, and have a 
      lower passenger capacity and speed as compared to heavy rail or rapid transit rail systems.<sup>15</sup>
