      //Inspired by the following tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_onclick
      //Declaring count at 1 instead of 0 because when you click it should display 1 not 0.
      //We use var instead of let because var is function scoped and let is limited by block//
      var count = 1;
    function clickfunction() {
    //HTML DOM Element innerHTML returns the innerHTML content of element, in this case the count number of button id "test"
    //++ will count by 1
      document.getElementById("button").innerHTML = count++;
